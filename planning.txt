Initially thought we’d just need to increment and decrement the life counters. But I remember when using these things in person the app would keep track of how much you’d just added/removed, which it would display for about 3 seconds. For example if you mashed the “subtract” button 4 times, it would display the new life total with 4 subtracted, but also a little bubble indicating -4. And if you clicked “add” before this disappeared, it would change the bubble to -3. So I’m thinking we might want to do something like keep track of how much the user has clicked in local react state, and then if they haven’t clicked it for 3 seconds or whatever we submit an “updateLifeByAmount” to the state and reset the local adjustment to 0.

It just occurred to me that it makes sense to allow for tracking more than just 2 players. Obviously it should default to 2 but we could totally allow for more. If that’s true we need to adjust how our system works to account for this. It means players are more like entities that can be added or removed.

I’m going to try using uuids for player ids. This is so overkill it’s disgusting but I want the practice.
